# Javascript Fundamentals Quiz

## Description

This is a simple desktop quiz that I decided to make to better my understanding of Javascript, CSS, as well as HTML. It can help you study, learn, or brush up on a couple of JS basics. I learned the importance of the order you code in, and how CSS and JS can clash with each other when trying to render new elements. It was nice to see it all work in the end.

## Installation

Simply fork and/or clone the repository from github to your own system and open the HTML in the browser of your choosing!

## Usage

When at the website page, simply click the start button! You'll get asked 5 questions on a timer about some JS fundamentals. Then, a prompt for your name will pop up. After that, your name and score will be saved to local and you can try to beat yourself or have your friends try!
